  title: About me
  summary: |
    A tinkerer at heart, I bring ample curiosity and technical expertise with domain knowledge from agriculture all the way to streaming video. My primary languages are Python, C++, and Java with AWS or Azure cloud. I've written data pipelines, desktop apps, and APIs with a healthy dose of infrastructure management and requirements elicitation. 

    I'm comfortable working anywhere in the stack, from ops all the way to UI. Outside of work I love wildlife photography, especially taking pictures of birds! You can take a look at my eBird account and photos [here](https://ebird.org/profile/MzU3NDY0Nw). I also love playing and writing RPGs and wargames, you can find my first attempt at writing an RPG [here](https://adelynflowers.github.io/five-minute-adventures/).

  title: Experience
  info:
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: 2024 - Present
      company: SAS Institute
      details: |
        _Stack_: Java, Python, Go, Azure

        I work on the Ops team at SAS, whose role is a bit broader than DevOps teams at other organizations. I handle
        everything from build pipelines and designing backend applications to security hardening and modernizing legacy apps.
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: 2022 - 2024
      company: Xperi TiVo, NC
      details: |
        _Stack_: Python, Spark, Airflow, AWS

        As a software engineer embedded within a data science team I built apps, 
        packages and CLI tools to help data scientists focus on work that matters. 
        This includes a heavy dose of writing ETL pipelines and managing 
        infrastructure like package servers, databases, and open source BI tools.

        _Notable Projects_
          - `the miss report`. A web app that identifies shortcomings 
          in our video recommendations, including automatic outlier detection
          and daily emails with suggestions for A/B tests. Suggestions made by the
          miss report have improved customer product performance by over 30% this year.
          - `uvh`. A desktop application that simplifies and aggregates information
          from multiple internal APIs in a clean and functional interfaces. This app saw
          universal adoption amongst customer-facing employees, and substantially reduced
          time to ticket resolution.
          - `emr-utils`. A python package and CLI tool to simplify launching and interacting
          with Amazon EMR. Allows data scientists to define and save their most common configurations,
          easily utilize spark connect for local development, and version control EMR configurations for
          future use. This package has greatly simplified day-to-day work for the team.
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2020 - 2022
      company: CSU - Sacramento, CA
      details: |
        _Stack_: C++, Python, Javascript

        On a small team dedicated to preserving California citrus from a frightening disease, Huanglongbing. I took
        the lead on designing and coding a model of disease spread. The model allowed for the testing of
        multiple intervention strategies, cooperation levels, grower preferences, and economic variables.
        I used these results to lead author a research paper, whose results we used as the source of outreach
        to CA citrus growers. This work continues today, with the original model still serving as a cornerstone for
        new research.

        _Notable Projects_
          - `hlb_model`. A cellular automata model of disease spread. Written from scratch in C++, the model
          was built to be run in parallel on HPCs that the team received from a grant.
          - `hlb cost estimator`. An interactive outreach website that helped farmers learn how to 
          slow the spread of HLB and plot how different intervention strategies that would impact
          their short and long-term profits.
          - `scheduler`. A python package/CLI tool for scheduling job submission to our IBM HPC. Abstracted
          technical details from team members with minimal programming experience.
    - role: Software Engineering Intern
      time: 2016 - 2020
      company: Quandary Escape Rooms, CA
      details: |
        _Stack_: C++, C#, Python

        Over the three years I was an intern at Quandary, I got to get my hands dirty writing
        customer-facing code. Initially brought on to help write C++ programs for the microcontrollers that served as the core escape room experience, my responsibilities expanded to include writing employee facing software and automating arduous business
        tasks.

        _Notable Projects_
          - `hint puncher`. Named for the punchy sound that customers had come to associate with receiving hints, hint puncher was an all-inclusive piece of game management software written in C#. Hint puncher replaced a previous combination of 4 paid pieces of software, allowed employees to manage multiple games at once, and provided an exact view of what customers saw in the room for ultimate control. Hint puncher remained in use for 5 years, dramatically increasing employee productivity and customer satisfaction while decreasing onboarding time.
          - `the trunk`. An all-in-one escape room that fit inside of an antique trunk and was used to promote the business at street fairs and other events. More than 8 microcontrollers were included throughout the trunk, powering everything from LED lightstrips, to motors, to pressure sensors and more. The trunk was wildly popular at every event it appeared at.
